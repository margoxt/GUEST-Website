# Company Website (Practice Project)

This is a **practice project** for building a responsive company website.  
The project helped me improve my frontend development skills using modern HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript.

## 🌐 Overview
The website includes common sections found on real business websites:
- Home
- About Us
- Services
- Contact Form
- Footer

## 💡 Purpose
This project was built to:
- Practice building static websites with responsive design
- Learn layout techniques using Flexbox/Grid
- Implement forms and basic client-side validation
- Improve general design and UI/UX skills

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**

## 📌 Notes

- This is a **personal learning project** and not an actual company website.
